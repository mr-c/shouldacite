You are writing up your research and wonder if you should cite a particular software package that you used.

# Should you cite this particular piece of software?

## 1. Does the software ask you to cite it?

* If **yes**, then do so following their guidelines.
* If **no**, then continue to question 2
* If you **don't know**:
    * Check for a file name [CITATION] or similar in the root directory of the
    software.
    * Check the [README] for the software, their website, and any output from
      running it.
    * Search the web for citation instructions: *"How to cite 'software name'?"*.
    * Check download page.
    * Email the authors, open an issue in their issue tracker, or ask on a user
      support forum. While waiting for a response continue to question 2.

## 2. Did the software play a critical part in, or contributed something unique to, your research?

* If **yes**, then you must cite the software.
* If **not**, or if you don't know, continue to question 3.

## 3. Did the software manipulate or create your data? This includes storage, visualization, and communication of your data and results.

 * If **yes**, then you need to cite the software.
 * If **not**, or if you don't know, continue to question 4

## 4. Do the authors of the software rely on academic credit for funding? Look for academic institutions in email addresses, URLs.

* If **yes**, then you must cite the software.
* If **not**, then you don't have to cite the software.
