You are writing up your research and wonder if you should cite a particular software package that you used.

# Should you cite this particular piece of software?

## 1. Did the software play a critical part in, or contributed something unique to, your research?

Hint: If you extend, script or automate the software, then you should cite the code.

* If **yes**, then you must cite the software.
* If **not**, or if you don't know, continue to question 2.

## 2. Did the software manipulate or create your data? This includes storage, visualization, and communication of your data and results.

 * If **yes**, then you need to cite the software.
 * If **not**, then you don't have to cite the software. However, look at question 3.

## 3. Do the authors of the software rely on academic credit for funding? Look for academic institutions in email addresses, URLs.

* If **yes**, then consider citing the software, as it will help the authors of the software continue their work.
