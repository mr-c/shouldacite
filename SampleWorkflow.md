Susie is a composites researcher who has **used** [ImageJ](http://imagej.net/) to process her microCT images.  Should she cite the software?

She doesn’t know so she uses the workflow in the chart:

1. Does ImageJ ask that it should be cited?
 
 She doesn’t know so follows the ‘I don’t know’ path.
 
 There is [no CITATION file](https://github.com/imagej/imagej) so she checks the [README](https://github.com/imagej/imagej/blob/master/README.md) which also does not contain information on how to cite.
 The website doesn’t show anything obvious so she does a search for ‘citing imagej’ which takes her to [FAQ page](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/docs/faqs.html#cite) giving the following information:

Here are three possible ways to reference ImageJ: 

> 1.	Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997-2015. 
> 2.	Schneider, C.A., Rasband, W.S., Eliceiri, K.W. "NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis". Nature Methods 9, 671-675, 2012.
> 3.	Abramoff, M.D., Magalhaes, P.J., Ram, S.J. "Image Processing with ImageJ". Biophotonics International, volume 11, issue 7, pp. 36-42, 2004. (This article is available as a PDF http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/docs/pdfs/Image_Processing_with_ImageJ.pdf) 

The paper in #2 has a link to the software, and has a DOI, so it is the best citation. Susie uses this citation for ImageJ.
